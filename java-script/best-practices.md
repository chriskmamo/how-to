# Variables

- Always declare variables with *const*.
- If you think the value of the variable can change, use *let*.
- If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use *var* (before 2015).
- Declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
- You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
